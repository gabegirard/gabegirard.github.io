			<h1>About Me</h1> <!-- the "h1" tag is for a top-level header -->
			<p>gabby__girard is a musician, yogi and graduate of Yoga Space's 200 hr YTT. From an early age he was steeped in the Shambhala lineage of Tibetan Buddhism that found its headquarters in his hometown of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Discovering yoga was a natural step in his spiritual path as his music career brought him to Toronto. Realizing the incredible transformational and healing potential yoga has to offer, Gabe fell to his knees at the altar of asana and strives to pass on to his students the rejuvenating and transcendental experiences that his long list of excellent teachers gave to him.

				Gabe has been a bandleader in Toronto for 8 years and his projects have taken on many forms.  The newest incarnation of his Quintet will be a jazz/tango group.  Selecting repertoire that spans Tangos history from mid/late 19th century Argentinian folk song to classical Tango (Carlos Gardel) to the abstract, Nuevo Tango of Astor Piazzolla, Tangoâ€™s rich history will be paid tribute to and fused with jazz sensibilities. 
				
				In his spare time, Gabe loves to explore Toronto and do stuff in parks
